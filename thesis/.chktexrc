# ChkTeX configuration for thesis
# See: https://www.nongnu.org/chktex/ChkTeX.pdf

# Suppress warnings:
# 1  - Command terminated with space (common with \maketitle, \mainmatter, etc.)
# 8  - Wrong length of dash (false positives for -- in compound words)
# 13 - Intersentence spacing (stylistic, not errors)
# 24 - Delete space to maintain page references (trailing whitespace, handled by editor)
# 36 - Vertical rules in tables (we use booktabs which avoids this)
# 38 - Punctuation in front of quotes (British vs American style)
# 40 - Punctuation inside math mode (false positive for factorial notation)
# 44 - User Regex (disabled)

CmdLine {
