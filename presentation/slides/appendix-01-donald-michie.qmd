::: {.notes}
Donald Michie was a polymath who bridged biology, computing, and artificial intelligence. His wartime experience at Bletchley Park, working alongside Alan Turing on Colossus, convinced him that machines could exhibit intelligent behavior through systematic processes.

MENACE — the Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine — was Michie's 1961 demonstration that learning could emerge from simple mechanical operations: matchboxes, colored beads, and a reinforcement rule.
