<span class="highlight">Expected free energy provides a Bayes-optimal formalization of the trade-off Michie identified.</span>

::: {.notes}
Donald Michie was a British AI pioneer who worked alongside Alan Turing at Bletchley Park.

In 1961, he built MENACE — a physical machine that learned to play Tic-Tac-Toe using matchboxes and colored beads.

By 1966, he was asking a deeper question: given that we can store all board positions, what is the optimal way to learn?

The difficulty, as he put it, lies in pricing information — how much immediate performance should an agent sacrifice to gather knowledge that might be useful later? This is the exploration-exploitation trade-off stated in its original form.

My thesis argues that expected free energy — an objective function from Bayesian inference — provides the formal answer Michie sought.

I will show how MENACE implements a special case of this objective and present empirical evidence supporting this correspondence.

## Thesis Contributions

1. A mapping from MENACE to Active Inference in Dirichlet-categorical terms
2. Identification of MENACE as an instrumental Active Inference agent
3. Empirical comparison with Active Inference variants and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines
4. A generative model in which $\lambda$ parameterizes the cost of information acquisition

::: {.notes}
My thesis makes four contributions.

First, a precise mapping from MENACE's mechanics to Active Inference using Dirichlet-categorical distributions.

Second, the identification that MENACE approximately corresponds to the purely instrumental special case of expected free energy — an agent that exploits without explicit information-seeking.

Third, empirical validation comparing MENACE against Active Inference variants and Reinforcement Learning baselines.

Fourth, a generative model within the Active Inference framework that explicitly parameterizes the cost of information acquisition which directly answers Michie's question by providing a formal mechanism to price information in the same units as outcomes.

I will now present the background on MENACE before developing this correspondence.

## Conclusions

<span class="highlight">Key Findings</span>

- Dirichlet-categorical mapping formalizes MENACE's Bayesian structure
- MENACE ≈ instrumental Active Inference ($\lambda = 0$) confirmed empirically
- $\lambda$ quantifies information cost with measurable short-horizon effects
- Dirichlet representation provides robustness that tabular RL lacks

<span class="highlight">MENACE is a historically remarkable, mechanizable special case of Active Inference.</span>

::: {.notes}
To summarize the key findings.

First, the theoretical contribution: the Dirichlet-categorical mapping formalizes MENACE's implicit Bayesian structure.

Second, instrumental equivalence: MENACE and an Active Inference agent with epistemic drive suppressed achieve comparable performance, supporting the identification of MENACE as the purely instrumental special case.

Third, the cost of information: explicit epistemic value (positive $\lambda$) reduces short-horizon performance, exactly as Michie predicted. The $\lambda$ parameter makes this trade-off an explicit design choice.

Fourth, robustness: the Dirichlet representation provides natural protection against distributional shift that tabular RL lacks, because restocking keeps all actions at positive probability.

The takeaway is that MENACE — a sixty-year-old physical learning machine — instantiates principles that remain central to modern Bayesian approaches to learning and decision-making.
